# PyBer_Analysis
Analysis using Mathplotlib, pandas and Numpy

# Overview of the analysis: 
  The purpose in this challenge is to analize a information of two data frames, which were merged, resulting in our final data set to analyze using pandas, numpy an matplotlib to visualize data.
  
  This challenge refers to the analysis of the ride-sharing data by city type, we have to show how fares differ from each city type (Urban, Suburban and Rural). We will use the resample() method to get a new data frame which contain data without NaN values, and this method also allows to display the information in weeks = 'W', months = 'M', year = 'Y' or day= 'D', because we have a date type in the index.
  Finally using Matplotlib we display the information for the final data frame to see how fares vary for each city type.
  

# Results: Using images from the summary DataFrame and multiple-line chart, describe the differences in ride-sharing data among the different city types.

# Summary: Based on the results, provide three business recommendations to the CEO for addressing any disparities among the city types.
